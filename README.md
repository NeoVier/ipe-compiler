Create modern backend applications using a strict functional programming language. Ipe tries to bring the Elm goodness to the backend, so we can build reliable and delightful apps all the way around!

This package includes the compiler for the Ipe language. If you want to compile your Ipe projects, you should look at [Ipe's CLI](https://github.com/NeoVier/ipe-cli)

## Design Goals

- A strictly-typed functional language
- Delightful to use when building backend apps

## Usage

You can use this package to parse, analyse and compile Ipe code in your Elm app! This means that folks who want to create tools for Ipe can do so in Elm, with access to the full AST and all that goodness.

## Learning Resources

Feel free to reach out to me on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/)! You can send me a DM or @ me, my username is `Henrique Buss`. Usually, programming language development is discussed in the #language-implementation channel.
